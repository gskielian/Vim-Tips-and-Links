My Settings
===========

Getting started with vim one can become overwhelmed with a lot of plugins and options that one doesn't know why it is even supposed to be interesting.

I'll try to answer that, and suggest the settings I use for begginers.



Use Maximum-awesome-squared
---------------------------

Visit the following project and install by `cd`-ing into the directory and using the `rake` command.

https://github.com/tsironis/maximum-awesome-squared

## Command line installation drawn out:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsironis/maximum-awesome-squared
cd maximum-awesome-squared
rake
```

if you don't have `rake` then you try the following (using package manager for your distro)

```bash
sudo apt-get install rake
```

Requires Jellybeans
